## Unit 27 - Must and can't

### Must

We use MUST to say that we feel sure something si true:
- You've been traveling all day. You must be tired.
- "Joe is a hard worker." "Joe? You must be kidding. He doesn't do anything."
- Louise must get very bored in her job. She does the same thing every day.
